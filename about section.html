<h4 style="font-size:40px"> <center> About </h3>

<p style="font-size:15px"> <center> My name is Skjold Gustafsson-Sherson and I am a student at AIS (Aarhus International School)
  <br> and I have made this website, as part of a school project. The task for the project was to find a community that I care
  <br>about, and design a product that can solve a problem within that community. I am a Vejle Boldklub fan, which is why I
  <br> chose to attempt to solve the problem that some Vejle Boldklub fans on the stands don’t know all the songs/chants, or maybe
  <br> they don’t know any at all. I have tried to solve this by creating this website, where one can find all the Vejle Boldklub
  <br> songs that I could find. The “Songs” section is where one can find the lyrics to the songs.
